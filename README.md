In this research project, two of my colleagues and I implemented the necessary tools and 
mathematics required to simulate the motion and path of a double pendulum using 
Euler-Lagrange equations in Python using mainly numpy and pandas libaries. We
then found some interesting relations between the angle phase portrait of a 
double pendulum's motion and its initial velocity, its ratio of lengths, and 
its angular velocity over time.

## Recommended IDE Setup
Any IDE that supports Python can run the code as long as the modules used are installed correctly beforehand.

For an easy visualization of the code, I recommend using [Google Collab](https://colab.google/), a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs.


## Link to the code
A full report containing the context and snapshots of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/Mathieu-Allaire/Double-Pendulum-Simulation/blob/main/Double_Pendulum.ipynb).
