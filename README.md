In this project, two of my colleagues and I implemented the necessary tools and mathematics required to simulate the motion and path of a double pendulum using Euler-Lagrange equations in Python using mainly numpy and pandas libaries. We then found some interesting relations between the angle phase portrait of a double pendulum's motion and its initial velocity, its ratio of lengths, and its angular velocity over time.
